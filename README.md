The A/B split testing data tells us that red backgrounds result in higher search impressions than green backgrounds. 

Include pychology of read backgrounds and links to further reading.

The data collection process was over a period of 60 days and for 45 items.
In order for the experiment to be unbias - all A/B listings have to have the same start and end time.

Limitations of the experiement -
The assessment was made that 60 days would be enough time to see valuable insights into trends, however, a longer time frame may have altered results.
More data for the total number of items may have altered results.
A variation in the type of item may have altered results. 

Ideas for future A/B split test to be carried out -
* Does title casing affect listing impressions? SnakeCasing vs ALL CAPS.
* Does emojis in item titles affect listing impressions? Titles with emojis vs titles without
* Does including a 'Best Offer' affect listing impressions? Best Offer vs without best offer
* Does free postage effect listing impressions? free postage (postage included in total item price) vs without free postage

The data collected from these multiple split tests would provide useful to creating a template to best maximise listing impressions for listings.
