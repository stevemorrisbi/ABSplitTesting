# A/B Split Testing
### Overview: Harnessing listing impression data to study how background colour can affect the total views of an item on an E-commerce platform.

The A/B split testing data tells us that red backgrounds result in higher search impressions than green backgrounds. 

Based on pre-experiment research of colour selection, it appears there is potenial validity to the colour red being seen as a 'cue to pay attention'. Further reading - https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/rewired-the-psychology-technology/201803/obsessiveaddictive-tiny-red-dots

## Data Collection - 
The data collection process was over a period of 60 days and for 45 items.
In order for the experiment to be unbias - all A/B listings had to have the same start and end time.

### Limitations of the experiement:
* The assessment was made that 60 days would be enough time to see valuable insights into trends, however, a longer time frame may have altered results.
* More data for the total number of items may have altered results.
* A variation in the type of item may have altered results.

The visualisations tell us that the general trend is a 20% increase in listing impressions from a green background to a red background. 

One of the limitations of the data is that the assumption has to be made that: listing impressions correlate with the likelyhood of a potential sale. To provide more definite insights into background colour influence on actual sales, sales data (which was not available) would have to be analysed, rather than assumptions made with active listings.

### Ideas for future A/B split test to be carried out:
* Does title casing affect listing impressions? SnakeCasing vs ALL CAPS.
* Does emojis in item titles affect listing impressions? Titles with emojis vs titles without.
* Does including a 'Best Offer' affect listing impressions? Best Offer vs without best offer.
* Does free postage effect listing impressions? free postage (postage cost included in total item price) vs without free postage.

The experiment results from these multiple split tests would be useful in creating a template to best maximise impressions for listings.
